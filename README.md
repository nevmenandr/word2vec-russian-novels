# word2vec-russian-novels

Fun digital humanities project by [Boris Orekhov](http://nevmenandr.net/bo.php)

Inspired by [this work](https://github.com/arnicas/word2vec-pride-vis) the replacement of words of Russian most valuable novels text with closest word2vec model words.

I used a [model](http://rusvectores.org/ru/models/) ([ruwikiruscorpora](http://rusvectores.org/static/models/ruwikiruscorpora_0_300_20.bin.gz)) from RusVectōrēs project.

Other dependencies:
* gensim
* [pymorphy2](https://pymorphy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/guide.html)

Possible applications:
* Fun
* Source for tests for so called "olympic" competitions in literature
* Base for literary studies that include the principle question "why this word, not the other?"
